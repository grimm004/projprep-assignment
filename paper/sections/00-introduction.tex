% Between 2 and 3 pages

This section briefly introduces the general project background, the research question you are addressing, and the project objectives.  It should be between 2 to 3 pages in length.  Do not change the font sizes or line spacing in order to put in more text.

Note that the whole report, including the references, should not be longer than 20 pages in length.  The system will not accept any report longer than 20 pages.  It should be noted that not all the details of the work carried out in the project can be represented in 20 pages.  It is therefore vital that the Project Log book be kept up to date as this will be used as supplementary material when the project paper is marked.  There should be between 10 and 20 referenced papers---references to Web based pages should be less than 10\%.
